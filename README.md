# RESTFormsRAD

RESTForms is a generalized REST API backend for web applications built on InterSystems (CachÃ© or Ensemble) backend.

RESTFormsRAD takes advantage of all features provided by RESTForms, but with a few modifications to attend to the RAD Studio needs.
# Development installation

This is a development version.

1. Clone repo
2. Build development image: `$ docker-compose build`
3. Run container: `$ docker-compose up -d`
3. Open an interactive session
```
  $ docker exec -it restforms2 bash
  $ iris session IRIS
```
4. Run all tests
```
  zn "restforms2"
  set ^UnitTestRoot = "/app/src/Form/UnitTests"
  do ##class(%UnitTest.Manager).RunTest("", "/nodelete")
```
  or run a specific test case
```
  zn "restforms2"
  set ^UnitTestRoot = "/app/src/Form/UnitTests"
  do ##class(%UnitTest.Manager).RunTest(":Form.UnitTests.ObjectCRUD", "/nodelete")

Postman
-----------

You can use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to query RESTForms API. [Collection](RESTForms.postman_collection.json). [Environment](CACHE.postman_environment.json).

# SQL requests

`GET http://localhost:57772/forms/form/objects/Form.Test.Simple/info?size=2&page=1&orderby=text`

`GET http://localhost:57772/forms/form/objects/Form.Test.Simple/all?orderby=text+desc`

`GET http://localhost:57772/forms/form/objects/Form.Test.Simple/all?filter=text%20eq%20A9044`

`GET http://localhost:57772/forms/form/objects/Form.Test.Simple/all?filter=text%20in%20A9044~B5920`

Note, that for SQL access user must have relevant SQL privileges (SELECT on form table).

## Queries

There are two query types:
   - Basic queries work for all RESTForms classes once defined and they differ only by the field list
   - Custom queries work only for the classes in which they are specified and available, but the user has full access to query text 

## Basic queries

Execute `form/objects/:class/:query` request, to call a simple query. Second `:query` parameter determines query type - the contents of query between SELECT and FROM. Here are default query types:


| Query    |  Description          |
|----------|-----------------------|
| all      | all information       |
| info     | displayName and id    |
| infoclass| displayName, id, class|
| count    | number of rows        |

RESTForms looks for a query named  `myq` in the following places (till first hit):
  1.  Class method `queryMYQ` in your form class
  2.  Parameter `MYQ` in your queries class
  3.  Class method `queryMYQ` in your queries class
  4.  Parameter `MYQ` in `Form.REST.Objects` class
  5.  Class method `queryMYQ` in `Form.REST.Objects` class

You can define your own queries class. To define your own query named `myq` there:
  1. Define a class `YourClassName`
  2. Define there a `MYQ` parameter or `queryMYQ` class method. Parameter takes precedence over the method. 
  3. Method or param must return the part of SQL query between SELECT and FROM
  4. (Once) Execute in a terminal: `Do ##class(For.Settings).setSetting("queryclass", YourClassName)`

Method signature is: `ClassMethod queryMYQ(class As %String) As %String` 

You can define a class-specific query. To define your own class query named `myq`:
  1. Define a `queryMYQ` class method in your form class
  2. Method signature is: `ClassMethod queryMYQ() As %String` 
  3. Method must return the part of SQL query between SELECT and FROM
  
## Custom Queries

Execute `form/objects/:class/custom/:query` request, to call a custom query.  Custom query allows user code to determine the full content of the query. URL parameters besides `size` and `page` are unavailable. Your method must parse all other url parameters. 

To define your own custom query named `myq`:
  1. Define a `customqueryMYQ` class method in your form class
  2. Method signature is: `ClassMethod customqueryMYQ() As %String` 
  3. Method must return a valid SQL query

## URL arguments:

All arguments are optional.

| Argument | Sample Value       | Description     |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| size     | 2                  | page size       |
| page     | 1                  | page number     |
| filter   | Value+contains+W   | WHERE clause    |
| orderby  | Value+desc         | ORDER BY clause |
| collation| UPPER              | COLLATION clause|
| nocount  | 1                  | Remove count of rows (speeds up query)|
| mode     | 0                  | SQL mode value. Can be 0 - Logical, 1 - ODBC, 2 - Display. Defaults to 0.|


## ORDER BY clause

Value can be: `Column` or `Column+desc`. Column is a column from the sql table or a colum number.

## WHERE clause 

In a format: `Column+condition+Value`. 

Several conditions are possible: `Column+condition+Value+Column2+condition2+Value2`.

If Value contains white spaces replace them with tabs before sending to the server.

Conditions:

| URL            | SQL         |
|----------------|-------------|
| neq            | !=          |
| eq             | =           |
| gte            | >=          |
| gt             | >           |
| lte            | <=          |
| lt             | <           |
| startswith     | %STARTSWITH |
| contains       | [           |
| doesnotcontain | '[          |
| in             | IN          |
| like           | LIKE        |

## COLLATION clause

In a format: `collation=UPPER` or `collation=EXACT`. 
Forces specified collation on WHERE clause. If omitted, default collation is used.

# Settings

You can setup several settings.
Set them via `Write ##class(For.Settings).setSetting(Setting, Value)`.

| Setting     | Values             | Description     |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| queryclass  | CachÃ© class name   | Class with your own queries. See Query types for details.|
| fileDir     | Directory path     | Directory for files. Defaults to MGR\DB directory|
| timezone    | ignore, utc        | Affects how timestamps are converted for a client. UTC has Z on end, ignore does not|


# Samples

See `Form.Test.Simple` and other forms in `Form.Test` package for samples. 
To generate test data execute: `do ##class(Form.Util.Init).populateTestForms()`
To remove test forms permanently from your local repository 
  1. Enter `Form\Test` directory from git bash
  2. `git update-index --assume-unchanged $(git ls-files | tr '\n' ' ')`
  3. Delete `Form\Test` directory

# Object creation

For `Form.Test.Simple`.

`POST http://localhost:57772/forms/form/object/Form.Test.Simple`
Headers must contain `Content-Type` and (probably) authorization

```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Basic Base64String
```  

Body:
```
{
        "_class":"Form.Test.Simple",
        "text":3
}
```

# Object update

Body:
```
{
        "_class":"Form.Test.Simple",
